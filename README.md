# Camping-Directory
An iOS Camping Directory

This is my first iOS application and I did it in Swift. The application makes use of [Active's Campground API](http://developer.active.com/docs/read/Campground_APIs) to enable campground searches and display details about a specific campground. One can also make reservations for a campsite using the application.

This application is more or less a learning exercise and you may encounter something in the code that could be done better. Please enter an issue here in GitHub and I will make the change. You could also join the team and help contribute to application if you wish.

Some of the items that I implemented within this application include:
* Remote API calls using AlamoFire
* Populating table views with XML data using SWXMLHash
* Extensions
* Mapkit
* Collection views
* Custom view cells
* Passing data via a seque
* Navigation controller with buttons
* Customizing an alert controller with an image

Feel free to use any part of the application according to the license (GPLv2).
